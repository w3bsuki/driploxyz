## üìà COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS PHASES

| Phase | Package | Score | Status |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| **4A** | packages/ui | 115/120 | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT |
| **4B** | packages/domain | 115/120 | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT |

## ‚úÖ RECOMMENDATION

### **APPROVED - PROCEED TO PHASE 4D**

Phase 4C successfully restructured apps/web following SvelteKit 2 best practices. The minor point deductions are due to:
1. Pre-existing TypeScript errors (not Phase 4C's fault)
2. Import documentation completeness
3. Minor verification gaps

**These do NOT block progression to Phase 4D.**

---

## üéØ ACTION ITEMS FOR PHASE 4D

Phase 4D (Core Package Audit) should address:

1. **Fix Core Package Exports**
   - Add missing ProductService export
   - Add missing ConversationService export
   - Verify all service exports are correct

2. **i18n Function Fixes**
   - Fix 50+ missing i18n function exports
   - Update i18n function naming to match usage
   - Ensure all translation keys exist

3. **Import Verification**
   - Verify all imports reference correct packages
   - Update any remaining `@repo/core/services/*` imports to `@repo/domain/*`
   - Ensure no framework contamination in core

4. **Final Cleanup**
   - Remove any remaining duplicate files
   - Verify no unused imports remain
   - Final TypeScript error count ‚Üí 0
