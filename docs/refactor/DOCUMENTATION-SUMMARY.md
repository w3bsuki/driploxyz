## 🎫 Ticket Summary (What Codex Will Do)

### ✅ COMPLETE: Ticket 1 - Toast System Consolidation
- **Status:** DONE (completed in this session)
- **Results:** 478 lines removed, 7 components migrated
- **Time:** 35 minutes
- **Validation:** Pending full test suite

### 🔄 REMAINING: Tickets 2-6

| # | Ticket | Priority | Time Est. | What It Does |
|---|--------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 2 | Service-Role Hardening | 🟡 HIGH | 2-3h | Lazy load admin clients, add audit logging |
| 3 | UI Package Cleanup | 🟡 HIGH | 2-3h | Remove demo files, move API logic to @repo/core |
| 4 | Testing Infrastructure | 🟡 HIGH | 4-5h | Add test configs, write tests, CI integration |
| 5 | Environment Validation | 🟢 MEDIUM | 1-2h | Update .env files, add version checks |

**Total remaining time:** 12-17 hours

---

## 📊 Current State (After Ticket 1)

### What's Already Done ✅
- Toast system consolidated (1 implementation instead of 3)
- 7 components migrated to use @repo/ui toast
- 478 lines of duplicate code removed
- ToastProvider from Melt UI integrated
- All onClick→onclick fixes applied
- Package builds successfully

### What's Pending ⏸️
- Full validation suite run (network-intensive turbo commands)
- E2E tests for toast functionality
- Bundle size metrics comparison

### Known Issues 🔧
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in some components (not related to toast changes)
- 3 Supabase security warnings (will be addressed in remaining tickets)

## 🚀 How to Use These Documents

### Step 1: Review (YOU)
1. Read `EXPLANATION-FOR-HUMAN.md` to understand what will happen
2. Review the task list and decide if you want to proceed
3. Check that the timeline (12-17 hours) works for you

### Step 2: Handoff to Codex Web
1. Copy the entire contents of `CODEX-QUICK-START.md`
2. Paste into Codex Web chat
3. Codex will:
   - Read the full documentation
   - Start with Ticket 2 (Service-Role Hardening)
   - Update task board as it progresses
   - Document changes in validation log

### Step 3: Monitor Progress
Watch these files for updates:
- `docs/refactor/task-board.md` - See current ticket status
- `docs/refactor/reports/phase-4-validation-log.md` - See detailed notes

### Step 4: Review When Complete
Codex will notify you when all tickets are done. Then:
1. Review the validation log
2. Run final tests yourself if desired
3. Merge the branch to main

---

## 🔬 Supabase MCP Integration

**What it is:** Codex can talk directly to your Supabase database using MCP commands.

**How Codex uses it:**
```
"@supabase list tables" → See all 45 database tables
"@supabase execute sql 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audit_logs'" → Run queries
"@supabase get advisors for security" → Check for security issues
```

**Current database state:**
- 45 tables in public schema
- 312 migrations applied (latest: 20250929082641_add_order_items_table)
- 3 security warnings (will be addressed in Ticket 2)

**Security warnings to fix:**
1. Auth OTP expiry too long (>1 hour)
2. Leaked password protection disabled
3. Postgres security patches available

---

## 📋 Validation Commands

These commands verify everything works after changes:

```powershell
# Core validation (always required)
pnpm --filter @repo/i18n build
pnpm --filter @repo/ui test
pnpm --filter web test
pnpm --filter web test:e2e
pnpm --filter web build
pnpm --filter web build:metrics

# Workspace validation (document quirks)
pnpm -w turbo run lint
pnpm -w turbo run check-types
pnpm -w turbo run build
```

Codex will run these after every ticket. You can also run them manually to verify progress.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What WON'T Change
- No changes to user-facing features
- No database schema changes
- No changes to API endpoints
- No breaking changes to public APIs

### What WILL Change
- Internal code organization (cleaner)
- Test coverage (better)
- Security posture (stronger)
- Bundle size (smaller)
- Performance (faster)

### Git Strategy
- Branch: `codex/audit-codebase-and-create-documentation` (current)
- Commits: One per ticket with detailed messages
- Merge: After all validation passes

### Risk Level
**Very Low** - This is maintenance/cleanup work, not feature development:
- All changes are tested before commit
- MCP validates backend changes
- Can revert any commit if issues arise
- Working on feature branch (not main)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know the refactor is complete when:

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ >1000 lines of code removed
- ✅ Bundle size reduced by >10%
- ✅ Test coverage increased by +20%
- ✅ TypeScript errors reduced by 50%

**Security:**
- ✅ All service-role clients lazy loaded
- ✅ Audit logging for privileged operations
- ✅ MCP security warnings addressed (0 remaining)

**Testing:**
- ✅ All packages have test configuration
- ✅ >50 new tests added
- ✅ E2E tests run in CI

**Documentation:**
- ✅ All tickets documented in validation log
- ✅ README updated with environment setup
- ✅ Svelte 5 migration checklist complete

---

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

**Codex gets stuck:**
- Check `task-board.md` to see what it's working on
- Read `phase-4-validation-log.md` for error details
- You can manually fix issues and tell Codex to continue

**Tests fail:**
- Codex will document the failure in validation log
- Review the error message
- Decide whether to fix manually or let Codex retry

**Build breaks:**
- All changes are in git - can revert easily
- Codex will catch build errors before committing
- Worst case: `git reset --hard HEAD~1` to undo last commit

**MCP connection lost:**
- Verify `.vscode/mcp.json` has correct project ref
- Restart VS Code if needed
- Test with: `"@supabase list tables"` in Copilot Chat

## 📞 Next Steps

### Immediate (NOW):
1. ✅ Read `EXPLANATION-FOR-HUMAN.md` (5 min)
2. ✅ Decide if you want to proceed
3. ✅ Copy `CODEX-QUICK-START.md` into Codex Web

### During Execution (Codex does this):
1. Read full specs from `CODEX-WEB-PROMPT.md`
2. Execute tickets 2-6 in order
3. Update task board after each ticket
4. Document changes in validation log
5. Run validation gates before committing

### After Completion (YOU):
1. Review `task-board.md` (should show all tickets ✅)
2. Review `phase-4-validation-log.md` (detailed notes)
3. Run validation commands yourself if desired
4. Merge branch to main when satisfied

## 🎉 Ready to Go!

Everything Codex needs is documented. The refactor is:
- ✅ Well-specified (detailed ticket specs)
- ✅ Low-risk (maintenance work, not features)
- ✅ Reversible (all changes in git)
- ✅ Validated (automated tests catch issues)
- ✅ Documented (easy to review)

**Total time investment for you:**
- Review: 10-15 minutes (reading EXPLANATION-FOR-HUMAN.md)
- Monitoring: 5 minutes per ticket (check task board)
- Final review: 30 minutes (when all tickets complete)

**Total time for Codex:**
- 12-17 hours of execution time
- Can work autonomously with these documents
