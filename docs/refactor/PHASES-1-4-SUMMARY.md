## 🚀 Phase 5: Business Logic Consolidation

### Ready to Start ✅

Phase 5 focuses on extracting business logic from `apps/web` into shared packages, establishing clear architectural boundaries, and enabling code reuse across all apps.

### Primary Goals
1. **Create `@repo/domain` package** for business logic
2. **Extract 40+ service files** from apps/web to shared packages
3. **Consolidate Stripe integration** in `@repo/core/stripe`
4. **Centralize email services** in `@repo/core/email`
5. **Clean up `@repo/ui`** package (remove non-UI code)
6. **Implement service-role hardening** for security
7. **Complete Phase 1 items** (Supabase upgrade, rate limiter)

### Target Architecture

**Before (Current):**
```
apps/web/
  ├── src/lib/services/    # 40+ service files ❌
  ├── src/lib/stripe/      # Payment logic ❌
  └── src/lib/email/       # Email templates ❌

packages/ui/
  └── src/lib/services/    # CategoryNavigationService ❌
```

**After (Phase 5):**
```
packages/domain/           # NEW: Business logic
  ├── src/services/
  │   ├── products/
  │   ├── orders/
  │   ├── profiles/
  │   ├── messaging/
  │   └── payments/
  └── src/validation/

packages/core/
  ├── src/stripe/          # Payment processing
  ├── src/email/           # Email services
  ├── src/analytics/       # Analytics
  └── src/monitoring/      # Logging

packages/ui/               # Pure design system
  ├── src/lib/primitives/
  └── src/lib/components/
```

### Success Criteria
