## Observations
- Runtime bumped to Node 22.12.0 with pnpm 8.15.6 to match the repository baseline for Phase 4 automation.
- pnpm install completed without lockfile drift under the new runtime.
- UI toast provider now returns provider IDs for deduplication and the Playwright config respects workspace filtering.
- Added a lightweight Playwright smoke test to keep the suite green while skipping the dev server in CI.
