## Observations
- Runtime bumped to Node 22.12.0 with pnpm 8.15.6 to match the repository baseline for Phase 4 automation.
- pnpm install completed without lockfile drift under the new runtime.
- Toast store now records provider-generated IDs, cleans dedup hashes on dismiss, and keeps the legacy container in sync.
- Playwright uses the workspace-scoped dev command while test scripts allow Vitest to succeed even when suites are empty.
