# Claude – Supabase Production Hardening Checklist

**Goal:** Validate every Supabase touch point (DB schema, functions, RPC, storage, auth) using the Supabase MCP toolchain. Close security, reliability, and DX gaps before launch.

---

## 1. Preparation

1. Launch the Supabase MCP integration and sync with the project identified in `supabase/config.toml`.
2. List outstanding migrations:
   - Directory: `supabase/migrations/`
   - Notable files: `20250929_add_order_items_table.sql`, `20250924_fix_messaging_primitives_complete.sql`, `20250910_add_messaging_rpcs.sql`, etc.
3. Review database types package:
   - `packages/database/src/index.ts`
   - Ensure generated types reflect the latest migrations.
4. Confirm environment variables present in `apps/web/.env.example` cover service role, anon, storage, Stripe, etc.

---

## 2. Migration Audit

- Use MCP to diff each migration file against the live database.
- Highlight breaking changes (e.g., restructuring categories, search vectors, order items) and confirm backfill scripts were executed.
- Ensure every migration contains `rollback` instructions or safe guards. If missing, create follow-up tasks.
- Verify that `20250924_fix_messaging_primitives_complete.sql` aligns with the messaging edge function payload expectations.

---

## 3. RLS & Policy Verification

- Enumerate all tables with RLS enabled. Key targets: `profiles`, `products`, `orders`, `messages`, `favorites`, `order_items`.
- For each table:
  - Confirm RLS is enabled.
  - Validate select/insert/update/delete policies.
  - Run MCP policy audit to ensure policies cover all roles (anon, authenticated, service).
- Pay special attention to messaging tables added in September migrations – confirm new RPCs (`get_conversation_messages`, `mark_conversation_read`, etc.) are secured.

---

## 4. Edge Functions & RPCs

### `supabase/functions/send-message/index.ts`

- Replace in-memory rate limit with persistent store (Redis, KV, or Supabase table). Document interim fix if persistence not ready.
- Avoid mixing service role for every broadcast. Investigate using channel auth with user JWT or dedicated `messages_admin` role.
- Log format: ensure structured logging matches Vercel/Supabase observability stack.
- Add unit/integration tests (Supabase testing harness) covering:
  - Auth failure
  - Rate limit enforcement
  - Successful message creation & broadcast

### RPC Health Check

- Use MCP to list all RPCs referenced in `apps/web/src/lib/services` and `packages/core`.
- Cross-check with lint/type failures (e.g., TypeScript errors referencing `get_conversation_messages`, `get_user_conversations`). Update RPC result types in `packages/database` and adjust SQL if shapes changed.

---

## 5. Storage & Bucket Policies

- Audit storage buckets used for product photos, avatars.
- Validate signed URL expirations align with frontend usage (check `apps/web/src/lib/services/products.ts` for download logic).
- Ensure background cleanup jobs exist for abandoned uploads. If missing, add tasks.

---

## 6. Authentication & Session Handling

- Verify JWT expiry and refresh logic (`apps/web/src/hooks.server.ts`, `packages/core/auth`).
- Confirm email magic link and OAuth providers configured; update `README` if scope changed.
- Check that Stripe customer portal webhooks map to Supabase auth metadata (see `supabase/migrations/20250929_add_order_items_table.sql` for relation expectations).

---

## 7. Monitoring & Backups

- Ensure automated backups are configured for prod project.
- Add health check endpoints or cron functions if missing (inspect `apps/web/src/routes/api/health/+server.ts`). Ensure Supabase metrics dashboards cover connections, latency, errors.

---

## 8. Deliverables

- Updated migration README summarizing risk areas (append to `supabase/README.md` or create `supabase/PRODUCTION-NOTES.md`).
- Checklist of RLS verifications stored in this file under `## Completion Report` once done.
- Ensure `pnpm --filter @repo/database build` regenerates types without diff.
- Document any manual Supabase console actions executed.

---

## 9. Sign-off Criteria

- MCP migration diff shows zero drift.
- Messaging flow passes integration test hitting Supabase edge function + RPC combo.
- Storage and bucket policies documented, with test artifact verifying upload/download.
- Supabase observability and backup strategy documented for on-call runbook.
