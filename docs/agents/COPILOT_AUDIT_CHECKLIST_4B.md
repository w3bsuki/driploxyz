## üéØ GRADE SCALE

- **90-109**: ‚úÖ **GOOD** - Solid execution with minor issues to fix.
- **70-89**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **ACCEPTABLE** - Works but needs improvements.

---

## üîç DETAILED VERIFICATION STEPS

### Step 1: Check File Structure
```powershell
# Verify domain structure exists
cd K:\driplo-turbo-1\packages\domain\src
ls

# Expected directories: cart, products, auth, orders, users, payments, shared
# Each should have: services.ts, validation.ts, types.ts, index.ts
```

### Step 2: Verify package.json Exports
```powershell
# Check exports are updated
cat K:\driplo-turbo-1\packages\domain\package.json | Select-String -Pattern "exports" -Context 0,20
```

Expected:
```json
"exports": {
  "./cart": {...},
  "./products": {...},
  "./auth": {...},
  ...
}
```

### Step 3: Check for Broken Imports
```powershell
# Search for old import patterns
cd K:\driplo-turbo-1
rg "@repo/domain/[^/]+-service" --type ts --type svelte

# Should return 0 results (all fixed)
```

### Step 4: Test Domain Build
```powershell
cd K:\driplo-turbo-1\packages\domain
pnpm run build

# Should complete without errors
```

### Step 5: Test Dev Server
```powershell
cd K:\driplo-turbo-1
pnpm --filter @repo/web dev

# Should start on http://localhost:5173/
# Open browser and check console for errors
```

### Step 6: Check Git Status
```powershell
git log -1 --oneline
git diff HEAD~1 --stat

# Should show Phase 4B commit with file changes
```

## üí° TIPS FOR AUDITING

- **Be thorough but fair** - Claude is doing complex work
- **Test everything** - Don't just read code, run it
- **Check edge cases** - Look for what might break
- **Verify dev server** - This is the most critical test
- **Document findings** - Help Claude (and user) understand issues
- **Be constructive** - Suggest fixes, not just criticism

---

## üéØ CRITICAL CHECKS

**These MUST pass for approval:**

1. ‚úÖ Dev server runs without errors
2. ‚úÖ No broken imports anywhere in monorepo
3. ‚úÖ Domain package builds successfully
4. ‚úÖ Changes committed to git
5. ‚úÖ Domain boundaries are clean (no circular deps)

**If any critical check fails ‚Üí REJECT and request fixes**

---

## üìû IF CLAUDE FAILS

**If score < 70 or critical checks fail:**

1. Document all issues clearly
2. Provide specific fix instructions
3. Let user decide: Fix manually or give Claude another chance
4. If manual fix needed, guide user through corrections

**If score >= 70:**
- Minor issues can be fixed by user or in Phase 4C
- Approve with conditions and document improvements needed

Good luck auditing! Be thorough and help Claude improve! üîçüíö
