<!-- CLAUDE_CODE: Technical Analysis & Recommendations -->

## 🤖 Claude Code Analysis

**CLAUDE_CODE: CRITICAL PATH OPTIMIZATION**
Based on the current codebase structure and CLAUDE.md requirements, the most critical bottleneck is likely database performance since this is a C2C marketplace with heavy read operations (product discovery/search). Prioritize Phase 1.1 Database Optimization before API security.

**CLAUDE_CODE: SVELTE 5 + TAILWIND V4 CONSIDERATIONS**
Phase 2 UI improvements must account for:
- Current Svelte 5 rune migration status (`$state`, `$derived`, `$props`)
- Tailwind v4 token system migration from `@repo/ui/styles/tokens.css`
- Existing Melt UI component wrappers in `packages/ui/src/lib/`
- "Rule of 2" compliance for component promotion to shared UI package

**CLAUDE_CODE: MONOREPO ARCHITECTURE IMPACT**
The Turborepo + pnpm workspace structure requires adjusted implementation:
- Phase 3.1 file organization should preserve workspace boundaries
- TypeScript strict mode in Phase 3.2 needs workspace-level `tsconfig` updates
- Testing strategy should leverage workspace filtering (`pnpm -w turbo run test`)
- Bundle optimization in Phase 2.2 should consider inter-package dependencies

**CLAUDE_CODE: SECURITY & COMPLIANCE ALIGNMENT**
Phase 1.2 security hardening must integrate with:
- Supabase RLS policies (already implemented but need performance optimization)
- Stripe payment security (PCI DSS compliance for marketplace)
- Bulgarian GDPR compliance requirements (mentioned in i18n setup)
- Rate limiting strategy that accounts for legitimate marketplace browsing patterns

**CLAUDE_CODE: PERFORMANCE BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS**
Adjust Phase 2 performance targets based on mobile-first C2C marketplace requirements:
- LCP target: 1.5s (more aggressive than 2s, aligns with CLAUDE.md)
- Bundle size: Target <500KB initial, <1MB total (current seems bloated)
- Image optimization critical for marketplace (product photos dominate payload)
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for product grids early in Phase 2.1

**CLAUDE_CODE: IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE OPTIMIZATION**
Recommended critical path adjustments:
1. Start with database indexes (biggest performance impact)
2. Implement error boundaries (prevents cascading failures)
3. Add monitoring before security hardening (visibility during changes)
4. UI optimizations can run parallel to backend work
5. Delay testing setup until core stability achieved

**CLAUDE_CODE: TOOLING INTEGRATION**
Leverage existing tooling mentioned in workspace:
- `pnpm run db:analyze` suggests database tooling exists
- Supabase CLI integration for migrations/deployments
- Likely Vercel deployment pipeline (check `vercel.json`)
- TypeScript strict mode enablement across all packages
