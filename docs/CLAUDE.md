**Last Updated:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Production Plan Finalized (A+ Grade)  
**Purpose:** Primary entry point for AI assistants executing the production plan

---

## üéØ Mission

Execute the complete production plan to launch Driplo as a production-ready, global luxury fashion marketplace.

**Target:** 8 weeks to production launch  
**Quality Standard:** Zero technical debt, best practices only, no over-engineering

---

## üìã Critical Context (Read These First)

### 1. **PRODUCTION_TASKS.md** ‚≠ê PRIMARY EXECUTION PLAN
**Your main playbook with 60+ MCP-annotated tasks**
- Complete execution plan across 8 tracks
- Every task has: tools, steps, acceptance criteria, deliverables
- Pre-flight checklist and production readiness scorecard
- **This is what you execute, line by line**

### 2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** üèóÔ∏è SYSTEM FOUNDATION

- Tech stack: Svelte 5 (runes only), Tailwind v4, Supabase, Paraglide v2

### 3. **CONTRIBUTING.md** üìù CODING STANDARDS
**Enforced patterns and quality gates**
- Svelte 5: runes only ($state, $derived, $effect, $props), snippets not slots
- SvelteKit 2: satisfies PageServerLoad, form actions, hooks.server.ts patterns
- TypeScript strict: no `any` without `@ts-expect-error`
- MCP usage policy: always consult before implementing

### 4. **IMPLEMENTED.md** ‚úÖ CURRENT STATE
**What's already built (don't rebuild these)**
- Search system: fully working with RPC functions (30-80ms queries)
- Database: 38 tables with RLS, 23 FK indexes, optimized policies
- Frontend: search dropdowns working, location detection implemented
- Recent fixes: Svelte 5 migration bugs resolved, product pages working

### 5. **PRODUCTION_PLAN.md** üìä PHASES & STATUS
**6 phases with current state assessment**
- Phase 1: ‚úÖ Foundation audit complete
- Phase 3: üîÑ Search backend done, UI integration pending
- Phases 2-6: detailed tasks, acceptance criteria, verification strategies

### 6. **ROADMAP.md** üó∫Ô∏è STRATEGIC VISION
**Product roadmap and timeline**
- Short-term: Feature complete, global ready, production launch
- 7-week timeline with weekly deliverables
- KPIs and risk mitigation

## üõ†Ô∏è MCP Tool Usage (MANDATORY)

### Svelte MCP (for all Svelte/SvelteKit work)
**Always follow this workflow:**
1. Call `mcp_svelte_list-sections` to see available docs
2. Call `mcp_svelte_get-documentation` with ALL relevant sections
3. Implement according to official patterns
4. Call `mcp_svelte_svelte-autofixer` to validate before committing

**When to use:**
- Any .svelte component changes
- SvelteKit routing, load functions, form actions, hooks
- Runes usage ($state, $derived, $effect, $props)
- Snippets and {@render} syntax
- Performance, accessibility, SEO patterns

### Context7 MCP (for third-party library docs)
**Workflow:**
1. Call `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` (e.g., "tailwind", "paraglide", "stripe")
2. Call `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with resolved library ID

**When to use:**
- Tailwind v4 design tokens and theme config
- Paraglide v2 i18n integration patterns
- TypeScript configuration best practices
- Stripe payment intent and webhook patterns
- Resend email API usage

### Supabase MCP (for database/backend work)
**Workflow:**
1. Call `mcp_supabase_search_docs` for feature documentation (e.g., "RLS", "Realtime", "Storage")
2. Call `mcp_supabase_get_advisors` for security and performance checks
3. Call `mcp_supabase_list_tables` to audit schema
4. Test migrations on development branch first (create_branch)
5. Call `mcp_supabase_apply_migration` after testing
6. Call `mcp_supabase_merge_branch` to promote to production

**When to use:**
- Any database schema changes (migrations)
- RLS policy creation or updates
- Supabase Realtime setup (publications)
- Storage bucket configuration
- RPC function creation
- Performance optimization (indexes)

---

## ‚úÖ Quality Gates (Must Pass Before Merge)

Every PR must pass:
1. **Lint**: `pnpm lint` (ESLint + Prettier)
2. **Type Check**: `pnpm check` (TypeScript strict, 0 errors)
3. **Tests**: `pnpm test` (Vitest unit tests)
4. **Build**: `pnpm build` (all apps and packages)
5. **MCP Validation**: Svelte autofixer pass, Supabase advisors clean

## üö® Critical Rules

### DO
- ‚úÖ Always consult MCP docs before implementing
- ‚úÖ Use Svelte 5 runes only ($state, $derived, $effect, $props)
- ‚úÖ Use snippets, never slots
- ‚úÖ Server-only modules for secrets (src/lib/server)
- ‚úÖ Form actions for mutations, not API routes (unless streaming/SSE)
- ‚úÖ RLS-first: enable RLS before writing policies
- ‚úÖ Test migrations on branch before merging
- ‚úÖ Run svelte-autofixer before committing
- ‚úÖ Update IMPLEMENTED.md with chronological entries

### DON'T
- ‚ùå Don't use legacy Svelte stores
- ‚ùå Don't use slots (use snippets)
- ‚ùå Don't use `any` without `@ts-expect-error` justification
- ‚ùå Don't use arbitrary Tailwind values (use design tokens)
- ‚ùå Don't put secrets in client bundles
- ‚ùå Don't create SECURITY DEFINER functions without justification
- ‚ùå Don't skip advisor checks before merging DB changes
- ‚ùå Don't merge without passing all quality gates

3. For EVERY task:
   - Consult the mandated MCP docs BEFORE implementing
   - Svelte MCP: list-sections ‚Üí get-documentation ‚Üí implement ‚Üí autofixer
   - Context7 MCP: for Tailwind v4, Paraglide, TypeScript, Stripe, Resend
   - Supabase MCP: for migrations, RLS, Realtime, Storage, advisors
4. Follow the 8-week execution order
5. Update the Production Readiness Scorecard as you complete tracks
6. Pass ALL quality gates: lint, type check, test, build, MCP validation

**Critical rules:**
- Svelte 5 runes only, snippets not slots
- SvelteKit 2 patterns (satisfies, actions, hooks)
- TypeScript strict, no stray `any`
- Tailwind v4 tokens, no arbitrary values
