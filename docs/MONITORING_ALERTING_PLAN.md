## 🤖 Claude Code Monitoring Analysis

**CLAUDE_CODE: SUPABASE-INTEGRATED MONITORING STACK**
Leverage existing Supabase monitoring capabilities:
- Supabase Dashboard for database performance metrics
- Real-time query monitoring via `pg_stat_statements`
- Connection pool monitoring and alerting
- Built-in log aggregation and analysis

**CLAUDE_CODE: SVELTEKIT + VERCEL MONITORING INTEGRATION**
Optimal monitoring for SvelteKit deployment:
```typescript
// Web Vitals tracking in app.html
import { getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB } from 'web-vitals';

function sendToAnalytics(metric) {
  // Send to Vercel Analytics
  analytics.track('web-vitals', {
    name: metric.name,
    value: metric.value,
    id: metric.id
  });
}

getCLS(sendToAnalytics);
getFID(sendToAnalytics);
getLCP(sendToAnalytics);
```

**CLAUDE_CODE: MARKETPLACE-SPECIFIC KPIs**
Critical metrics for C2C marketplace success:
- **Conversion Funnel**: Search → View → Contact → Purchase
- **Listing Quality**: Image load time, description completeness
- **User Engagement**: Session duration, return visitor rate
- **Transaction Health**: Payment success rate, dispute frequency

**CLAUDE_CODE: REAL-TIME MESSAGING MONITORING**
Monitor WebSocket performance for marketplace communication:
```typescript
// Connection health monitoring
supabase.channel('connection-health')
  .on('system', { event: '*' }, (payload) => {
    analytics.track('realtime-event', {
      event: payload.type,
      latency: Date.now() - payload.timestamp
    });
  });
```

**CLAUDE_CODE: PAYMENT MONITORING INTEGRATION**
Stripe webhook monitoring and alerting:
- Payment intent success/failure rates
- Webhook delivery success tracking
- Chargeback and dispute monitoring
- Payout timing and failure alerts

**CLAUDE_CODE: ERROR BOUNDARY MONITORING FOR SVELTE 5**
Client-side error tracking integration:
```svelte
<!-- Error boundary component -->
<script lang="ts">
  import * as Sentry from '@sentry/svelte';
  
  let error = $state(null);
  
  function handleError(err) {
    Sentry.captureException(err);
    error = err;
  }
</script>

{#if error}
  <ErrorFallback {error} />
{:else}
  <slot />
{/if}
```

**CLAUDE_CODE: PERFORMANCE BUDGET ALERTS**
Marketplace-specific performance thresholds:
- **Product Page LCP**: >1.5s (critical for conversions)
- **Search Response**: >500ms (user experience)
- **Image Load Time**: >2s (visual content priority)

**CLAUDE_CODE: SECURITY MONITORING INTEGRATION**
Leverage existing Sentry configuration for security events:
- Failed authentication attempt patterns
- Unusual API access (potential scraping)
- Payment fraud indicators
- File upload security violations

**CLAUDE_CODE: BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE DASHBOARDS**
Marketplace health visualization:
```sql
-- Daily active sellers metric
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT seller_id) as active_sellers
FROM products 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);

-- Search success rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE results_count > 0) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as success_rate
FROM search_events
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

**CLAUDE_CODE: ALERT PRIORITIZATION FOR MARKETPLACE**
Context-aware alert routing:
- **P0 (Immediate)**: Payment processing down, database unreachable
- **P1 (15 min)**: Search functionality broken, image uploads failing
- **P2 (1 hour)**: Performance degradation, high error rates
- **P3 (24 hours)**: Trends analysis, capacity planning

**CLAUDE_CODE: MOBILE-FIRST MONITORING**
Special considerations for mobile marketplace users:
- Network condition impact on performance
- Device-specific error patterns
- Touch interaction success rates
- App-like behavior metrics (PWA)
