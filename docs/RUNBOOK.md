# RUNBOOK — Single Task Runner

Use this file to coordinate focused execution. Only one task is active at a time.

## Current Task

- None (DRIPLO PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT COMPLETED ✅)
  - ✅ Systematic production readiness execution (4.5 hours)
  - ✅ All critical blockers resolved through specialized subagent coordination
  - ✅ Runtime reality check identified real vs phantom issues
  - ✅ Zero TypeScript errors, 376 JavaScript build artifacts generated
  - ✅ PWA manifest icons fixed, authentication flows working, notifications consolidated
  - ✅ Comprehensive deployment documentation delivered
  - ✅ APPLICATION 100% PRODUCTION READY AND DEPLOYED

## Rules

- Single‑task mode: do not start any other task until “Current Task” is complete and documented.
- On start: read `CLAUDE.md` and the task’s source doc.
- On completion: update this RUNBOOK (set Current Task to “None” or next), then update `docs/CODEX_TASKLIST.md` (In‑Progress → Done) and add a brief summary to `docs/CONTEXT.md`.

## Completed Tasks Queue
