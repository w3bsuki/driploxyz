# Tech Stack Playbooks — How To Use

Purpose: Give Claude‑code focused, executable guidance per technology to reach V1 quality. Each playbook has Best Practices, Anti‑Patterns, Refactor Tasks, and Short Prompts. Execute in order, tick checkboxes, and commit in small PRs.

Order of execution
1) typescript.md
2) svelte5.md
3) sveltekit2.md
4) paraglide.md
5) tailwindcss-v4.md
6) melt-ui.md
7) supabase.md
8) playwright.md

Workflow
- Read the playbook’s Best Practices and Anti‑Patterns.
- Do the Refactor Tasks top‑down, committing per logical chunk.
- Paste the Short Prompts into your run as needed.
- Update docs/CODEX_TASKLIST.md and the playbook checkboxes when complete.
