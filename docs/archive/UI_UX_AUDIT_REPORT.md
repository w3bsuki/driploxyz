# UI/UX Audit Report: Driplo E-commerce Platform

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive UI/UX audit evaluates the Driplo fashion marketplace platform across key user journeys, accessibility compliance, and performance indicators. The audit reveals a well-structured SvelteKit application with modern architecture but identifies several critical opportunities for improving user experience, particularly in mobile navigation, search functionality, and product discovery.

### Key Findings
- **Navigation**: Bottom navigation needs redesign for better mobile experience
- **Search**: Functional but lacks advanced filtering and visual hierarchy
- **Product Discovery**: Category pages need better density and filtering
- **Mobile Experience**: Some components not optimized for touch interactions
- **Accessibility**: Generally good structure but needs contrast and focus improvements

## Methodology

### Audit Scope
- **Pages Analyzed**: Home, Search, Category, Product Detail, Sell Flow, Auth, Profile
- **Devices**: Mobile (390x844) and Desktop (1280x800)
- **Evaluation Framework**: Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics + E-commerce Specific Heuristics
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance Metrics**: LCP, CLS, and Core Web Vitals

### Analysis Approach
1. **Code Review**: Analyzed component structure, state management, and interaction patterns
2. **User Journey Mapping**: Evaluated critical paths from discovery to purchase
3. **Heuristic Evaluation**: Applied established usability principles
4. **Accessibility Audit**: Reviewed semantic HTML, ARIA implementation, and keyboard navigation
