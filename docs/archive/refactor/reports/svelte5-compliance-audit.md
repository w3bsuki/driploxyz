# Svelte 5 Compliance Audit – Phase 4

**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary
- Replaced the app-level toast store with a thin adapter over `@repo/ui`'s Melt-powered implementation.
- Removed the legacy toast container component and now render `ToastContainer` from `@repo/ui/primitives` in `+layout.svelte`.
- Deleted `packages/ui/src/lib/stores/toast-store.svelte.ts` and `packages/ui/src/lib/my-counter-class.svelte.ts` to eliminate Svelte 4-era artifacts.
- All remaining `.svelte.ts` files rely on rune-friendly helpers or imported stores from the UI package, ensuring a single Svelte 5 code path.

## Validation
- `pnpm --filter web test` (Vitest) – ensures the new adapter works with mocked environments.
- Manual review of `find . -name '*.svelte.ts'` confirmed no duplicate implementations remain.

## Next Steps
- Continue migrating any app-specific UI patterns into `@repo/ui` to keep rune usage centralized.
- Track future Melt UI updates that introduce first-class runes APIs for additional primitives.
