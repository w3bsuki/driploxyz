<!-- CLAUDE_CODE: Comprehensive Roadmap Analysis & Strategic Implementation Guide -->

## ü§ñ Claude Code Strategic Analysis

**CLAUDE_CODE: CRITICAL PATH OPTIMIZATION FOR C2C MARKETPLACE**
Based on mobile-first C2C marketplace requirements, adjust the 40-day timeline:

**High-Impact Quick Wins (Days 1-10):**
- Database indexes for product search (immediate user experience impact)
- Image optimization and CDN setup (marketplace visual performance)
- Error boundaries in Svelte 5 (prevents user-facing crashes)
- Basic monitoring setup (visibility during optimization)

**Core Marketplace Functionality (Days 11-25):**
- Real-time messaging optimization (buyer-seller communication)
- Payment security hardening (Stripe PCI compliance)
- Search and filtering performance (core discovery experience)
- Mobile responsiveness validation (mobile-first requirement)

**CLAUDE_CODE: SVELTE 5 + TAILWIND V4 MIGRATION CONSIDERATIONS**
Special focus areas for current tech stack:
- Complete Tailwind v4 token migration in `packages/ui/src/styles/`
- Verify all components use Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$props`)
- Ensure Melt UI wrappers are properly integrated
- Validate "Rule of 2" component promotion to shared UI package

**CLAUDE_CODE: MONOREPO WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION**
Leverage Turborepo + pnpm workspaces effectively:
```bash
# Parallel development workflow
pnpm -w turbo run dev --parallel
pnpm -w turbo run check-types --continue
pnpm -w turbo run test --filter=!docs

# Deployment pipeline
pnpm -w turbo run build --filter=web
pnpm -w turbo run lint --filter=@repo/ui
```

**CLAUDE_CODE: PERFORMANCE BUDGET ENFORCEMENT**
Marketplace-specific performance targets:
- **LCP**: <1.5s (product page critical for conversions)
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB initial, <1MB total (mobile data considerations)
- **API Response**: <300ms (search/filter responsiveness)
- **Database Queries**: <100ms (marketplace scale requirements)

**CLAUDE_CODE: SECURITY COMPLIANCE FOR MARKETPLACE**
Multi-layered security approach:
- **Payment Security**: PCI DSS compliance via Stripe
- **User Data**: GDPR compliance (Bulgarian market)
- **Content Security**: Image upload validation and scanning
- **API Security**: Rate limiting with marketplace usage patterns

**CLAUDE_CODE: DEPLOYMENT & INFRASTRUCTURE STRATEGY**
Optimal stack for Svelte 5 + Supabase marketplace:
- **Frontend**: Vercel (SvelteKit optimization)
- **Database**: Supabase (integrated auth + real-time)
- **Images**: Supabase Storage + CDN
- **Payments**: Stripe (marketplace-ready)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry + Vercel Analytics + Supabase Monitoring

**CLAUDE_CODE: RISK MITIGATION & ROLLBACK PROCEDURES**
Critical safeguards for production launch:
- Database migration rollback scripts
- Feature flags for major UI changes
- Canary deployments for API changes
- Real-user monitoring during rollouts
- Automated health checks and alerting

**CLAUDE_CODE: SUCCESS METRICS & KPI TRACKING**
Marketplace-specific success indicators:
- **Technical**: Core Web Vitals, error rates, uptime
- **Business**: Listing creation rate, search success rate, transaction completion
- **User Experience**: Session duration, bounce rate, conversion funnel
- **Security**: Failed auth attempts, suspicious activity detection

**CLAUDE_CODE: TIMELINE RISK ASSESSMENT**
Potential bottlenecks and mitigation strategies:
- **Database Migration Delays**: Pre-test migrations in staging environment
- **Tailwind v4 Complexity**: Gradual migration with fallback CSS
- **Svelte 5 Compatibility**: Comprehensive component testing
- **Performance Regression**: Continuous performance monitoring

**CLAUDE_CODE: POST-LAUNCH OPTIMIZATION PIPELINE**
Continuous improvement after 40-day timeline:
- A/B testing framework for conversion optimization
- Advanced analytics for user behavior insights
- Machine learning for search ranking improvements
- International expansion considerations (i18n scaling)
