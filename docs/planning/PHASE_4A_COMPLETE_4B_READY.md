## üöÄ Phase 4B: Ready to Execute

**What's Phase 4B:**
Restructure `packages/domain` to organize business logic by domain boundaries:
- cart
- products  
- auth
- orders
- users
- payments
- shared

**Approach:**
Follow the same pattern that worked perfectly for Phase 4A:
1. Audit current structure
2. Create import mapping JSON
3. Copy files (keep old as backup)
4. Update package.json exports
5. Create PowerShell scripts for import fixes
6. Run scripts systematically
7. Fix edge cases
8. Test domain build
9. Test monorepo build
10. **TEST DEV SERVER** ‚Üê Critical!
11. Delete old files
12. Rebuild & re-test
13. Commit

## üéØ How to Start New Chat

### Option 1: Copy-Paste Prompt
Open `NEW_CHAT_PHASE_4B_PROMPT.md` and copy the entire contents into a new chat.

### Option 2: Short Version
Just paste this in the new chat:

```
Hey! I need help executing Phase 4B: Domain Package Restructure for my monorepo.

Please read and execute the plan in:
K:\driplo-turbo-1\PHASE_4B_FRESH_START_PROMPT.md

Phase 4A (UI restructure) is complete and working perfectly. Now we need to apply the same systematic approach to reorganize the domain package by business boundaries.

Start by reading the execution guide, then begin Step 1: Audit Domain Package Structure.
```

## üí° Tips for New Chat

**Do's:**
- ‚úÖ Read PHASE_4B_FRESH_START_PROMPT.md completely before starting
- ‚úÖ Create TODO list to track progress
- ‚úÖ Use PowerShell scripts for all import fixes
- ‚úÖ Test dev server before deleting old files
- ‚úÖ Ask for clarification if anything is unclear

**Don'ts:**  
- ‚ùå Skip reading the execution guide
- ‚ùå Try to do manual import fixes
- ‚ùå Delete old files before testing passes
- ‚ùå Commit broken state
- ‚ùå Rush through steps

---

## üìä Expected Timeline

Based on Phase 4A experience:
- Step 1-2 (Audit & Design): ~10 minutes
- Step 3-4 (Copy & Update exports): ~5 minutes
- Step 5-7 (Import fix scripts): ~15 minutes
- Step 8-11 (Testing): ~10 minutes
- Step 12-13 (Cleanup & Commit): ~5 minutes

**Total: ~45 minutes** (assuming no major issues)

## üéâ Good Luck!

You did an amazing job on Phase 4A! The systematic approach with PowerShell scripts worked perfectly. Now let's apply the same methodology to Phase 4B.

The new chat will have fresh context, the detailed execution guide, and all the lessons learned from this session.

**Next steps:**
1. Open new chat with GitHub Copilot
2. Copy contents of `NEW_CHAT_PHASE_4B_PROMPT.md`
3. Paste into new chat
4. Let the AI execute Phase 4B following the guide

## üìù Notes

- Phase 4A took multiple attempts to get right, but we learned from mistakes
- The final successful pattern is documented in PHASE_4B_FRESH_START_PROMPT.md
- PowerShell scripts are key to success (systematic, repeatable, less error-prone)
- Testing dev server before cleanup saved us from committing broken state
- This approach should work for any package restructure (4C, 4D, etc.)

**Phase 4A Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Phase 4B Status:** ‚è≥ READY TO EXECUTE  
**Dev Server:** ‚úÖ WORKING  
**Git Status:** ‚úÖ CLEAN
