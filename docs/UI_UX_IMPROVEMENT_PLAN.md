3. **Test Compatibility**: Don't break existing tests
4. **Performance**: No heavy dependencies or performance regressions

### Development Approach
1. **Component-First**: Focus on individual component improvements
2. **Incremental**: Implement changes in small, testable increments
3. **Backward Compatible**: Maintain existing functionality during transitions
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor impact of all changes

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual component changes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **E2E Tests**: Test critical user journeys
4. **Performance Tests**: Monitor LCP, CLS, and bundle sizes
5. **Accessibility Tests**: Verify WCAG compliance

### Success Metrics
1. **User Engagement**: 
   - Increased search usage (target: +20%)
   - Improved product discovery (target: +15% time on category pages)
2. **Conversion Metrics**:
   - Improved sell flow completion (target: +25%)
   - Better purchase conversion (target: +10%)
3. **Performance**:
   - LCP < 2.5s on mobile (target: 90th percentile)
   - CLS < 0.1 (target: 95th percentile)
4. **Accessibility**:
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (target: 100% of critical journeys)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance Regressions**: Monitor bundle sizes and loading times
2. **Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility during transitions
3. **Mobile Compatibility**: Test across various devices and screen sizes
4. **Browser Support**: Ensure cross-browser compatibility

### User Experience Risks
1. **Learnability**: Changes should be intuitive for existing users
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure improvements don't reduce accessibility
3. **Performance**: Enhanced features shouldn't impact performance
4. **Consistency**: Maintain design consistency across the platform

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Gradual Rollout**: Implement changes incrementally with feature flags
2. **A/B Testing**: Test major changes with user groups
3. **User Testing**: Validate changes with real users
4. **Monitoring**: Track metrics and user feedback closely
