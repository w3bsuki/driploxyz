# ü§ñ Claude CLI Agent: Execute Phase 4C - Core Package Audit & Verification

## üéØ YOUR MISSION

You are a **systematic execution agent**. Your job is to audit and verify the `packages/core` package to ensure it remains **framework-agnostic** and properly structured.

**Your output will be audited by GitHub Copilot**, so be thorough and document everything you do.

---

## üìã CRITICAL CONTEXT

**Monorepo:** `K:\driplo-turbo-1\` (SvelteKit 2 + Turborepo)  
**Shell:** PowerShell (Windows)  
**Phase Status:**
- ‚úÖ Phase 4A Complete: UI package restructured (174 components)
- ‚úÖ Phase 4B Complete: Domain package restructured (7 domains)
- ‚è≥ Phase 4C: Core package audit (YOU ARE HERE)

**Current State:**
- Core package is framework-agnostic (Phase 1 complete)
- Need to verify NO framework contamination
- Need to ensure proper exports
- Dev server works on http://localhost:5173/

---

## üìö EXECUTION PLAN

**Primary reference:** This file contains your complete checklist below.

**For additional context, read:** `K:\driplo-turbo-1\PHASE_4_COMPLETE_RESTRUCTURE.md` (lines 100-150)
- Core package requirements
- Framework independence rules
- Export structure expectations

**You can execute from this file alone**, but reading the detailed plan will help you understand the "why" behind each step.

---

## üéì LESSONS FROM PHASE 4A & 4B

**What worked perfectly:**
- Systematic audit before making changes
- Creating import mapping JSON for tracking
- Using PowerShell scripts for systematic fixes
- Testing builds before claiming completion
- Testing dev server to ensure nothing broke
- Single commit at the end with excellent message

**What to avoid:**
- ‚ùå Manual import fixes (error-prone)
- ‚ùå Making changes without audit first
- ‚ùå Skipping verification steps
- ‚ùå Multiple commits during execution

---

## ‚úÖ YOUR CHECKLIST (10 Steps)

Follow these 10 steps **in order**. After each step, document what you found.

### Step 1: Audit Core Package Structure ‚è≥
**Goal:** Understand current state and verify framework independence.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Read entire `packages/core/src/` directory
- [ ] List all files with their purposes
- [ ] Check directory structure matches requirements:
  ```
  packages/core/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/         # Pure functions only
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/      # Framework-agnostic services
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validation/    # Zod schemas
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/         # TypeScript types
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
  ```
- [ ] **OUTPUT:** Create `PHASE_4C_CORE_AUDIT.md`

### Step 2: Check Framework Independence ‚è≥
**Goal:** Verify NO framework-specific code exists.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Search for Svelte imports: `from 'svelte'`
- [ ] Search for SvelteKit imports: `from '$app/*'`, `from '$env/*'`
- [ ] Search for @sveltejs imports: `from '@sveltejs/*'`
- [ ] Search for Supabase client usage: `createClient(`, `new SupabaseClient`
- [ ] Search for browser-specific code: `window.`, `document.`, `localStorage`
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Core must be 100% framework-agnostic!
- [ ] **OUTPUT:** Document all findings in audit file

**Expected result:** ZERO matches for any framework-specific code.

### Step 3: Verify Export Structure ‚è≥
**Goal:** Ensure package.json exports are properly configured.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Check `packages/core/package.json` exports section
- [ ] Verify main export points to correct files
- [ ] Verify utils, services, validation, types exports
- [ ] Check if any exports are missing or incorrect

**Target exports structure:**
```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
      "default": "./dist/index.js"
    },
    "./utils": {
      "types": "./dist/utils/index.d.ts",
      "default": "./dist/utils/index.js"
    },
    "./services": {
      "types": "./dist/services/index.d.ts",
      "default": "./dist/services/index.js"
    },
    "./validation": {
      "types": "./dist/validation/index.d.ts",
      "default": "./dist/validation/index.js"
    },
    "./types": {
      "types": "./dist/types/index.d.ts",
      "default": "./dist/types/index.js"
    }
  }
}
```

- [ ] **OUTPUT:** Document current vs. target exports

### Step 4: Check Dependencies ‚è≥
**Goal:** Verify dependencies are framework-agnostic.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Check `packages/core/package.json` dependencies
- [ ] Verify NO Svelte or SvelteKit in dependencies
- [ ] Verify NO Supabase client in dependencies (types OK)
- [ ] Allowed dependencies: TypeScript, Zod, pure JS libraries
- [ ] **OUTPUT:** List all dependencies and verify each is appropriate

### Step 5: Audit Import Usage Across Monorepo ‚è≥
**Goal:** See how core package is being used.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Search for `@repo/core` imports across apps/
- [ ] Search for `@repo/core` imports across packages/
- [ ] Check if imports are using correct paths:
  - ‚úÖ `from '@repo/core/utils'`
  - ‚úÖ `from '@repo/core/services'`
  - ‚ùå `from '@repo/core/src/utils'`
- [ ] **OUTPUT:** Document import patterns and any issues

### Step 6: Test Core Package Build ‚è≥
**Goal:** Verify core package builds successfully.

**Actions:**
```powershell
cd K:\driplo-turbo-1\packages\core
pnpm run build
```

- [ ] Verify build completes without errors
- [ ] Check TypeScript compilation: `pnpm run check-types`
- [ ] **OUTPUT:** Build result (success/failure)

### Step 7: Check for Type Errors ‚è≥
**Goal:** Ensure no TypeScript errors in core package.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Run TypeScript compiler on core package
- [ ] Check for any `any` types that should be properly typed
- [ ] Verify type exports are correct
- [ ] **OUTPUT:** TypeScript error count (should be 0)

### Step 8: Verify No Circular Dependencies ‚è≥
**Goal:** Ensure core doesn't depend on domain or ui.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Check imports in core package
- [ ] Verify core DOES NOT import from @repo/ui
- [ ] Verify core DOES NOT import from @repo/domain
- [ ] Core can only import from @repo/database (types only)
- [ ] **OUTPUT:** Document any violations

**Dependency rules:**
```
core ‚Üí database (types only) ‚úÖ
core ‚Üí ui ‚ùå FORBIDDEN
core ‚Üí domain ‚ùå FORBIDDEN
```

### Step 9: Update Exports if Needed ‚è≥
**Goal:** Fix any export issues found in Step 3.

**Actions:**
- [ ] If exports are incorrect, update `packages/core/package.json`
- [ ] If files are missing index.ts, create them
- [ ] Test exports work: Try importing from each export path
- [ ] **OUTPUT:** List any changes made

**Only if changes needed!** If exports are already correct, skip to Step 10.

### Step 10: Create Summary & Commit ‚è≥
**Goal:** Document findings and commit any changes.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Complete `PHASE_4C_CORE_AUDIT.md` with:
  - Current structure analysis
  - Framework independence verification
  - Export structure verification
  - Dependency audit
  - Import usage patterns
  - Issues found (if any)
  - Recommendations
- [ ] If changes were made: Rebuild core package
- [ ] If changes were made: Test monorepo build
- [ ] Commit changes (if any) OR document "no changes needed"
- [ ] **OUTPUT:** Commit hash OR "No changes required" message

**Commit message format (if changes made):**
```

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Your audit passes if:
- ‚úÖ Zero framework-specific imports found
- ‚úÖ Exports properly configured
- ‚úÖ Dependencies are framework-agnostic only
- ‚úÖ Core package builds successfully
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ No circular dependencies with ui/domain

---

## üí° TIPS FOR SUCCESS

**This is primarily an AUDIT, not a restructure:**
- Focus on verification and documentation
- Only make changes if issues are found
- If core is already correct, document that
- Be thorough in your searches

**Framework Independence Searches:**
```powershell
# Search for Svelte imports
rg "from ['\"]svelte" packages/core/src/

# Search for SvelteKit imports
rg "from ['\"]\\$app" packages/core/src/
rg "from ['\"]\\$env" packages/core/src/

# Search for browser APIs
rg "(window\.|document\.|localStorage)" packages/core/src/

# Search for Supabase client
rg "createClient|new SupabaseClient" packages/core/src/
```

---

## üîç WHAT GITHUB COPILOT WILL AUDIT

After you finish, Copilot will verify:
1. ‚úÖ Is core truly framework-agnostic?
2. ‚úÖ Are exports properly configured?
3. ‚úÖ Are dependencies clean?
4. ‚úÖ Did you document findings thoroughly?
5. ‚úÖ Were any changes needed? If so, were they correct?
6. ‚úÖ Does core package build?
7. ‚úÖ Is audit documentation complete?

**Be thorough!** This is a verification phase, so accuracy matters more than speed.

---

## üöÄ BEGIN EXECUTION

Start with Step 1: Audit the `packages/core/src/` directory structure and create `PHASE_4C_CORE_AUDIT.md`.

Document your findings as you go. Good luck! ü§ñ

---

## üìù NOTES

- Phase 4C is primarily an **audit and verification phase**
- You may find core is already perfect (that's OK!)
- Document everything, even if no changes are needed
- This ensures core package foundation is solid for future phases
- Typical execution time: ~20-30 minutes

**Remember:** Your work will be audited by Copilot. Make them proud! üíö
