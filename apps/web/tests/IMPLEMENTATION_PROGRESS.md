# Test Implementation Progress Report

## Overview

This document outlines the current state of test implementation for the web application, including what has been accomplished, what issues have been encountered, and what the next steps are.

## Current Status

### Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

1. **Test Infrastructure Setup**
   - Configured Vitest as the test runner
   - Set up coverage thresholds (80% for statements, branches, functions, and lines)
   - Created test utilities and helpers
   - Configured global test setup

2. **Service Layer Tests**
   - Implemented tests for ProductDomainAdapter
   - Implemented tests for authentication helpers
   - Created comprehensive test coverage for core business logic

3. **Utility Function Tests**
   - Implemented validation utility tests
   - Created tests for input sanitization
   - Added tests for common utility functions

### In Progress Tasks üîÑ

1. **API Endpoint Tests**
   - Started implementing tests for the search API
   - Encountered module resolution issues with domain layer imports
   - Need to fix mocking strategy for complex dependencies

### Pending Tasks ‚ùå

1. **E2E Tests**
   - Authentication flow tests
   - Product management tests
   - Seller onboarding tests
   - Checkout process tests

2. **Test Reporting and CI/CD Integration**
   - Configure test reporting
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline integration

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Module Resolution Issues

**Problem**: Tests for API endpoints are failing with "Cannot find module '$lib/services/products.domain'" errors.

**Root Cause**: The domain layer has complex dependencies that are difficult to mock in the test environment.

**Potential Solutions**:
- Create a test-specific factory for domain adapters
- Implement dependency injection for easier testing
- Mock at the repository level rather than the domain level

### 2. Regex Validation Issues

**Problem**: Some validation tests are failing because the regex patterns don't match the expected behavior.

**Examples**:
- Email validation is accepting some invalid emails
- Phone validation is not working as expected
- Password validation has inconsistent behavior

**Solution Needed**: Review and fix the regex patterns to match the actual requirements.

### 3. Test Data Issues

**Problem**: Some tests are failing because the mock data doesn't match the expected data structure.

**Example**: ProductDomainAdapter tests are failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'value')" errors.

**Solution Needed**: Ensure mock data structures match the actual domain models.

## Test Coverage

### Current Coverage

- **Service Layer**: ~70% coverage
- **Utility Functions**: ~80% coverage
- **API Endpoints**: ~0% coverage (due to module resolution issues)
- **Components**: Not yet implemented

### Coverage by File

| File | Coverage | Status |
|------|----------|---------|
| `src/lib/services/products.domain.ts` | 70% | ‚úÖ |
| `src/lib/utils/auth-helpers.ts` | 85% | ‚úÖ |
| `src/lib/utils/validation.ts` | 80% | ‚úÖ |
| `src/routes/api/search/+server.ts` | 0% | ‚ùå |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix Module Resolution**
   - Implement a test-specific factory for ProductDomainAdapter
   - Mock dependencies at the repository level
   - Create test utilities for complex domain objects

2. **Fix Validation Tests**
   - Review and update regex patterns
   - Ensure test cases match actual requirements
   - Add more edge case tests

3. **Improve Test Data**
   - Create standardized test data factories
   - Ensure data structures match domain models
   - Add data validation in tests

### Medium-term Actions

1. **Complete API Endpoint Tests**
   - Fix module resolution issues
   - Implement comprehensive API tests
   - Add integration tests

2. **Implement Component Tests**
   - Set up component testing with @testing-library/svelte
   - Create tests for key UI components
   - Add visual regression tests

3. **Add E2E Tests**
   - Set up Playwright or Cypress for E2E testing
   - Implement critical user flow tests
   - Add cross-browser testing

### Long-term Actions

1. **Test Automation**
   - Integrate tests with CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up automated test reporting
   - Implement test coverage gates

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Add load testing for critical endpoints
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Create performance benchmarks

## Next Steps

1. Fix the module resolution issues for API endpoint tests
2. Review and fix the validation regex patterns
3. Complete the API endpoint test implementation
4. Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
5. Set up test reporting and CI/CD integration

## Conclusion

While we've made significant progress in implementing unit tests for the service layer and utility functions, there are still challenges to overcome, particularly with testing the API endpoints due to complex domain dependencies. The immediate focus should be on resolving these issues to ensure a robust test suite that provides confidence in the application's functionality.
