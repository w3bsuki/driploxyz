## Phase 1: Critical Build Blockers (Week 1)

### Objective
Resolve all build failures to establish a working foundation for further improvements.

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Fix FormField Export Issue
**Issue:** `FormField` component not exported from @repo/ui package  
**Impact:** Complete build failure  
**Files to Modify:**
- `packages/ui/src/lib/index.ts` - Add FormField to exports
- Verify FormField component exists in `packages/ui/src/lib/components/forms/`

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check if FormField exists
find packages/ui/src -name "*FormField*" -type f

# After fix, verify build
pnpm --filter @repo/ui build
pnpm --filter web build
```

#### 1.2 Build @repo/domain Package
**Issue:** Domain package exists but not built (no dist folder)  
**Impact:** Import resolution failures  
**Files to Modify:**
- `packages/domain/tsup.config.ts` - Verify build configuration
- Ensure all source files are properly structured

**Commands:**
```bash
# Build domain package
cd packages/domain
pnpm build

# Verify dist folder created
ls -la packages/domain/dist/

# Test integration
pnpm --filter web build
```

#### 1.3 Fix TypeScript Errors
**Issue:** Type safety violations preventing clean build  
**Impact:** Runtime errors possible  
**Files to Modify:**
- Replace all `any` types with proper interfaces
- Fix missing type exports
- Resolve import path issues

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check TypeScript errors
pnpm --filter web check-types

# Fix issues systematically
# Then verify clean build
pnpm --filter web build
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All packages build successfully
- [ ] Web app builds without errors

2. Replace `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces
3. Remove unused imports
4. Clean up dead code paths

**Commands:**
```bash
# Run linter to see current errors
pnpm --filter web lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
pnpm --filter web lint --fix

# Manually fix remaining issues
# Then verify clean lint
pnpm --filter web lint
```
