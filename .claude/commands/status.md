# /status - Project Status Check

Run a quick status check on the Driplo project.

## Check the following:
1. Read WORK.md to see current tasks and progress
2. Run `pnpm check-types` to count TypeScript errors
3. Run `pnpm build:web` to verify build status
4. Check current git branch and status
5. Report on mobile performance (current LCP)

Provide a concise status report with:
- TypeScript errors count
- Build status
- Current task progress
- Any critical blockers
