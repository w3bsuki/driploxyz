## üîç VERIFICATION COMMANDS

### 1. Verify Framework Independence

```powershell
# Search for Svelte imports
cd K:\driplo-turbo-1\packages\core
rg "from ['\"]svelte" src/
# Expected: 0 results

# Search for SvelteKit imports
rg "from ['\"]\\$app" src/
rg "from ['\"]\\$env" src/
# Expected: 0 results

# Search for browser APIs
rg "(window\.|document\.|localStorage)" src/
# Expected: 0 results (or justified)

# Search for Supabase client
rg "createClient|new SupabaseClient" src/
# Expected: 0 results
```

### 2. Check Exports

```powershell
# Check package.json exports
cd K:\driplo-turbo-1\packages\core
cat package.json | Select-String "exports" -Context 0,20

# Expected: Proper export configuration
```

### 3. Check Dependencies

```powershell
# Check for framework dependencies
cat package.json | Select-String "dependencies" -Context 0,10

# Should NOT contain: svelte, @sveltejs/*, @supabase/supabase-js (only @supabase/ssr types OK)
```

### 4. Test Build

```powershell
cd K:\driplo-turbo-1\packages\core
pnpm run build

# Expected: Clean build with 0 errors
```

### 5. Check TypeScript Errors

```powershell
cd K:\driplo-turbo-1\packages\core
pnpm run check-types

# Expected: 0 errors
```

### 6. Check Circular Dependencies

```powershell
# Check if core imports from ui or domain
cd K:\driplo-turbo-1\packages\core
rg "@repo/(ui|domain)" src/

# Expected: 0 results (core shouldn't depend on ui or domain)
```

## üéØ CRITICAL CHECKS (Must Pass)

**These MUST pass for approval:**

1. ‚úÖ Framework independence verified (0 framework imports)
2. ‚úÖ Core package builds successfully
3. ‚úÖ No circular dependencies with ui/domain
4. ‚úÖ Audit documentation complete
5. ‚úÖ Dependencies are framework-agnostic

**If any critical check fails ‚Üí REJECT and request fixes**

## üí° SPECIAL NOTES FOR PHASE 4C

**This is an AUDIT phase, not a restructure:**
- It's OK if Claude finds NO issues (means core is already perfect)
- Focus should be on thorough verification
- Documentation quality is crucial
- Changes should only be made if issues are found

**What makes a good Phase 4C audit:**
1. Comprehensive framework independence checks
2. Clear documentation of findings
3. Accurate assessment of current state
4. Actionable recommendations (if issues found)

**What makes a bad Phase 4C audit:**
1. Superficial checks without thorough searches
2. Missing documentation
3. Claiming issues exist when they don't (false positives)
4. Missing real issues (false negatives)

---

## üöÄ USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. **After Claude CLI finishes**, they will provide an audit report
2. **Read their report** to understand their findings
3. **Use this checklist** to verify their audit quality
4. **Run verification commands** to confirm their findings
5. **Score each section** based on audit thoroughness
6. **Calculate total score** and assign grade
7. **Provide audit report** with findings and approval status

Good luck auditing! Verify thoroughly! üîçüíö
