# DRIPLO REFACTOR PLAN - NO BULLSHIT EDITION

## Current Status: PHASE 1 COMPLETE ✅

## The 5-Phase Plan (Simple & Direct)

### PHASE 1: CLEANUP (COMPLETED)
**Goal:** Delete unnecessary files, clean build artifacts
- [x] Reduced 41 .md files to 3 essential ones (README, CLAUDE, SVELTEKIT_AUDIT_MASTER, REFACTOR_PLAN)
- [x] Deleted 126 Playwright screenshots
- [x] Deleted all dist/, .svelte-kit/ folders
- [x] Fixed .gitignore properly
- [x] Validated everything still builds and runs

**Results:**
- **Deleted:** 38 .md files, 126 images, all build artifacts
- **Kept:** Only essential documentation
- **Build:** Still works ✅
- **Dev Server:** Still runs ✅
- **TypeScript:** No errors ✅

### PHASE 2: COMPONENT AUDIT (COMPLETED)
**Goal:** Find and eliminate duplicate components
- [x] Audited all components in apps/web vs packages/ui
- [x] Fixed all Svelte 5 event handler violations (on:click → onclick)
- [x] Fixed form submission handlers (on:submit → onsubmit)
- [x] Verified no more Svelte 4 patterns remain

**Results:**
- **Fixed:** 7 event handler violations in 5 components
- **Verified:** All components use $props(), no export let
- **Verified:** All components use modern event syntax
- **Dev Server:** Still runs ✅
- **Cookie Consent:** Found 3 implementations (needs consolidation in Phase 3)

### PHASE 3: SVELTE 5 COMPLIANCE
**Goal:** Ensure 100% Svelte 5 patterns
- [ ] Convert any remaining old syntax to runes
- [ ] Fix any $: reactive statements
- [ ] Remove all export let (use $props())
- [ ] Validate with svelte-check

### PHASE 4: SUPABASE OPTIMIZATION
**Goal:** Optimize queries and reduce egress
- [ ] Audit all database queries
- [ ] Add proper indexes
- [ ] Optimize RLS policies
- [ ] Batch related queries

### PHASE 5: PRODUCTION PREP
**Goal:** Final optimization and testing
- [ ] Bundle size < 200KB
- [ ] Lighthouse > 90
- [ ] Remove all console.logs
- [ ] Final security audit

## Rules
1. **NO OVER-ENGINEERING** - Simplest solution wins
2. **DELETE FIRST** - Remove before adding
3. **TEST AFTER EACH CHANGE** - Break nothing
4. **BRUTAL HONESTY** - Call out any BS immediately
