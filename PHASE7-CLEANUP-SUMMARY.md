### Routes
- apps/web/src/routes/category/slug_disabled

## Completed Work

### Phase A: Analyzer Baseline ✅
- Ran knip, ts-prune, depcheck, jscpd, svelte-check analyzers
- Identified 208 unused files, 200+ unused exports, 1000+ unused message keys
- Found 1835 svelte-check errors and 15 warnings
- Identified 10 unused devDependencies
- Commit: feed3071

### Phase B: Artifacts and Temp Files ✅
- Removed 12 temporary files from root directory
- Removed apps/web/playwright-report directory and apps/web/nul file
- Updated ESLint configs for database and UI packages
- Added @types/node to database package
- Commit: efaa39f9

### Phase C: Documentation Archive ✅
- Moved 13 stale documentation files to docs/archive/refactor/
- Moved reports/ and workflows/ subdirectories to archive
- Added deprecation banners with links to current documentation
- Preserved historical documentation for reference
- Commit: e84760c9

## Next Steps

The following tasks remain to be completed:

1. Remove disabled route: apps/web/src/routes/category/slug_disabled
2. Fix ESLint configuration for remaining packages
3. Fix TypeScript errors in i18n package (missing Vite types)
4. Remove unused components and exports identified by analyzers
5. Fix remaining svelte-check errors and warnings
6. Remove unused devDependencies identified by depcheck
7. Run final verification (lint, typecheck, test, build)
8. Remove temporary analyzer dependencies

## Impact

The cleanup work completed so far has:

1. Reduced repository clutter by identifying and documenting 33 files for removal
2. Improved .gitignore to prevent future tracking of temporary files and build artifacts
3. Organized historical documentation in a dedicated archive directory
4. Installed necessary analyzer tools for continued code quality improvement
5. Created comprehensive documentation of all cleanup activities

The repository is now better organized and ready for the remaining cleanup tasks.
