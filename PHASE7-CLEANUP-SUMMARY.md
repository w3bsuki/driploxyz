This document summarizes the cleanup and deep prune work completed in Phase 7 of the project.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Temporary Files and Build Artifacts
- ✅ Identified and documented 12 temporary files in the root directory
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to exclude all temporary files and build artifacts
- ✅ Documented playwright-report directory in apps/web

- ✅ Documented disabled route in CLEANUP-DELETE-MANIFEST.json

### 4. Analyzer Tools Installation
- ✅ Added analyzer tools to root package.json:
  - knip: ^5.39.0 (for detecting unused files/exports)
  - ts-prune: ^0.10.3 (for detecting unused TypeScript exports)
  - depcheck: ^1.4.7 (for finding unused dependencies)

  - svelte-check: ^4.0.10 (for accessibility and diagnostics)

### 5. Documentation and Tracking
- ✅ Created CLEANUP-CANDIDATES.md to aggregate all potential cleanup candidates
- ✅ Updated CLEANUP-DELETE-MANIFEST.json with all identified files for deletion
- ✅ Updated CLEANUP-REPORT.md with detailed batch information
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to exclude all identified artifacts

## Next Steps

The following tasks remain to be completed:

1. Run static analyzers (knip, ts-prune, depcheck, jscpd) to identify specific candidates
2. Remove unused components in packages/ui
3. Remove unused keys/resources in packages/i18n
4. Remove unused services/types in packages/domain
5. Remove unused edge functions in supabase/functions/
6. Fix ESLint configuration to parse all packages and ignore generated files
7. Fix TypeScript errors and eliminate unused variables/exports
8. Run final verification (lint, typecheck, test, build)
9. Remove temporary analyzer dependencies

## Impact

The cleanup work completed so far has:

1. Reduced repository clutter by identifying and documenting 33 files for removal
2. Improved .gitignore to prevent future tracking of temporary files and build artifacts
3. Organized historical documentation in a dedicated archive directory
4. Installed necessary analyzer tools for continued code quality improvement
5. Created comprehensive documentation of all cleanup activities

The repository is now better organized and ready for the remaining cleanup tasks.
