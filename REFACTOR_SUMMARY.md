# Refactor Initiative Summary
**Date:** 2025-09-29
**Status:** Planning Complete, Ready for Execution

---

## What We're Doing

Systematic technical debt reduction to transform this monorepo from documentation theater into working, maintainable software.

---

## Why Now?

### The Reality Check
- **Test coverage:** 0.05% (11 tests for 20,614 files)
- **Build failures:** 2 of 4 apps broken
- **Type safety:** 14 compilation errors
- **Documentation:** 23 root markdown files (mostly obsolete)
- **Architecture:** Apps contain business logic that should be in packages

### The Cost
- Developers scared to make changes (might break something)
- New features take longer (unclear where code goes)
- Bugs multiply (no tests to catch regressions)
- Onboarding is painful (too much to read, unclear what's current)

### The Opportunity
- Fix critical issues in 2 days
- Establish proper architecture in 1 week
- Add test coverage incrementally
- Ship with confidence

---

## What Success Looks Like

### Quantitative Targets
| Metric | Before | Target | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| TypeScript errors | 14 | 0 | Type-safe refactoring |
| Lint errors | 18 | 0 | Code quality |
| Test coverage | 0.05% | 60% | Confidence to ship |
| Build success | 50% (2/4) | 100% (4/4) | Deploy anytime |
| Root docs | 23 | <10 | Find answers fast |
| Apps/web size | 2.9MB | ~1.5MB | Clear boundaries |
| Core package | 50KB | ~400KB | Shared logic |

### Qualitative Goals
- ✅ Developer can onboard in <1 hour
- ✅ Changes can be made without fear
- ✅ Tests catch bugs before production
- ✅ Documentation is trustworthy
- ✅ Deployments are boring (in a good way)

---

## The Plan (6 Phases)

### Phase 0: Stop the Bleeding (1-2 days) 🔥
**Critical blockers preventing progress**

**Focus:** Fix what's broken NOW
- Regenerate database types (schema drift)
- Fix 14 TypeScript errors
- Fix 18 lint errors
- Get all builds passing

**Output:** Clean baseline for refactor work

**Document:** [PHASE_0_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md](./PHASE_0_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md)

---

### Phase 1: Documentation Consolidation (1 day) 📚
**Reduce cognitive load, establish single source of truth**

**Focus:** 23 docs → <10 essential docs
- Create README.md (missing!)
- Consolidate architecture docs
- Consolidate framework guides
- Archive obsolete completion reports
- Delete failed phase system (MAIN.md)

**Output:** Navigable, trustworthy documentation

**Document:** [DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION.md)

---

### Phase 2: Architecture Rationalization (3-5 days) 🏗️
**Fix package boundaries, eliminate duplication**

**Focus:** Proper monorepo structure
- Create @repo/domain package (business logic)
- Expand @repo/core (services, integrations)
- Reorganize @repo/ui (pure components)
- Clean apps/web (app-specific code only)

**Output:** Clear separation of concerns, no duplication

**Document:** [ARCHITECTURE_SIMPLIFICATION.md](./ARCHITECTURE_SIMPLIFICATION.md)

---

### Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure (2-3 days) 🧪
**Establish testing culture, add critical path coverage**

**Focus:** Tests that matter
- Remove `--passWithNoTests` flags
- Set coverage thresholds (core: 70%, domain: 80%)
- Write service layer tests
- Add E2E tests for critical flows

**Output:** Confidence to refactor and ship

**Document:** See REFACTOR_MASTER_PLAN.md Phase 3

---

### Phase 4: Build System Stabilization (1-2 days) 🔧
**All workspaces build cleanly with consistent tooling**

**Focus:** Reliable pipeline
- Fix docs app build
- Resolve Vite plugin conflicts
- Optimize Turbo caching
- Clean up dependencies

**Output:** Fast, reliable builds

**Document:** See REFACTOR_MASTER_PLAN.md Phase 4

---

### Phase 5: Incremental Quality (Ongoing) 📈
**Continuous improvement without blocking progress**

**Focus:** Steady progress
- Address TODO/FIXME markers
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility improvements
- Security hardening

**Output:** Production-grade quality

**Document:** See REFACTOR_MASTER_PLAN.md Phase 5

---

### Phase 6: Production Readiness (2-3 days) 🚀
**Deploy with confidence**

**Focus:** Launch preparation
- Full pipeline passes in CI
- E2E tests on staging
- Performance audit (Lighthouse >90)
- Monitoring and alerting configured

**Output:** Shipped to production!

**Document:** See REFACTOR_MASTER_PLAN.md Phase 6

## How to Execute

### Daily Workflow
1. **Pick next task** from [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) (work top-to-bottom)
2. **Create feature branch** (`git checkout -b refactor/task-name`)
3. **Make small changes** (1-2 hours of work max)
4. **Write tests** (if applicable)
5. **Validate** (`pnpm lint check-types test build`)
6. **Commit** (working state)
7. **Push & create PR** (review before merging)
8. **Move to Done** in ROADMAP.md

### Progress Tracking
- **ROADMAP.md** - Simple Kanban (Critical → High Priority → Backlog)
- Update daily
- Mark done immediately
- Celebrate wins

### Communication
- Daily standup: What's done, what's next, any blockers
- Weekly review: Metrics, adjust priorities
- Ship small, iterate fast

---

## Key Documents

### Strategic Planning
- **[REFACTOR_MASTER_PLAN.md](./REFACTOR_MASTER_PLAN.md)** - Complete strategy (this is the master doc)
- **[REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md](./REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md)** - This summary
- **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)** - Current priorities and progress

### Phase Execution Guides
- **[PHASE_0_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md](./PHASE_0_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md)** - Critical fixes (start here)
- **[ARCHITECTURE_SIMPLIFICATION.md](./ARCHITECTURE_SIMPLIFICATION.md)** - Phase 2 detailed plan
- **[DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION.md)** - Phase 1 detailed plan

### Reference (Read as Needed)

- **Svelte5.md, SvelteKit2.md** - Framework guides (will be consolidated)
- **TailwindCSS.md, Paraglide.md** - Styling and i18n (will be consolidated)

---

## Principles

### 1. Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation
Stop writing plans, start fixing code. Ship fast, iterate faster.

### 2. Testing Gives Confidence
Write tests before refactoring. Tests catch bugs, documentation doesn't.

### 3. Incremental Progress
Small validated improvements > big bang rewrites. Ship or revert, no "almost done."

### 4. Measure Everything
Use metrics to track progress, not vibes. Numbers don't lie.

### 5. Ruthless Prioritization
Fix critical paths first, polish later. Perfect is the enemy of shipped.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ **Creating new docs instead of fixing code** - We have enough docs
- ❌ **"Almost done" syndrome** - Ship it or revert it
- ❌ **Perfectionism** - 80% working code > 100% perfect plan
- ❌ **Scope creep** - Finish current phase before starting next
- ❌ **Hero commits** - Break work into reviewable chunks (<500 lines)

---

## Decision Framework

### When to Add to Critical (🔥)
- Production is broken
- Deployments are blocked
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Data loss risk identified

### When to Archive Documentation
- Hasn't been updated in 6+ months
- Superseded by newer docs
- Completion report (historical)
- No clear owner or purpose

### When to Add Tests
- Before refactoring existing code
- Critical user flows (auth, checkout, messaging)
- Business logic (calculations, validation)
- Bug fixes (regression prevention)

### When to Refactor
- After writing tests
- When adding new features
- During code review if unclear
- NOT for aesthetics (functional > pretty)

---

## Risk Management

### What Could Go Wrong?

**Risk:** Breaking production during refactor
**Mitigation:**
- Write tests first
- Use feature branches
- Deploy to staging first
- Monitor error rates closely

**Risk:** Scope creep, never finishing
**Mitigation:**
- Strict phase boundaries
- Time-box work (2-week sprints max)
- Ship incrementally
- Say no to nice-to-haves

**Risk:** Team disagreement on architecture
**Mitigation:**
- Document decisions in ADRs
- Small experiments before big changes
- Review with stakeholders early
- Accept good enough solutions

**Risk:** Lost productivity during transition
**Mitigation:**
- Don't block feature work entirely
- Critical bugs take priority
- Pair on refactor work
- Document as you go

## Questions?

**Q: Why not just hire more developers?**
A: More developers = more confusion without proper architecture. Fix the foundation first.

**Q: Can we skip testing and just ship?**
A: You're already shipping without tests. That's why we're in this situation.

**Q: This seems like a lot of work for little visible progress.**
A: Foundation work enables all future features. Invest now, reap benefits forever.

**Q: What if we find more problems during execution?**
A: That's expected. Add to ROADMAP.md backlog, don't derail current phase.

**Q: How do we know when we're "done"?**
A: When all Phase 0-6 tasks are complete and metrics hit targets. Then switch to Phase 5 (continuous improvement).

## Conclusion

**The Problem:** Technical debt is crushing velocity and confidence.

**The Solution:** Systematic refactor over 2-3 weeks to establish solid foundation.

**The Outcome:** Fast, confident development with reliable deployments.

**The First Step:** Execute Phase 0 today. Fix what's broken, then build what's right.
