## 🚨 REMAINING TECH DEBT

### High Priority
1. **Search Page Over-complexity**
   - 15+ category queries can be reduced to 2-3
   - Category hierarchy caching needed
   - File: `apps/web/src/routes/search/+page.server.ts:200-350`

2. **Missing Error Boundaries**
   - Add error boundaries around dynamic content
   - Graceful degradation for failed API calls
   - File: Components missing error handling

3. **Image Performance**
   - Implement proper lazy loading with IntersectionObserver
   - WebP conversion pipeline
   - Responsive image sizing

### Medium Priority
1. **Toast System Duplication**
   - Still have legacy and modern toast systems running
   - Complete migration to Melt UI toasts
   - Files: `packages/ui/src/lib/toast-store.ts`

2. **Service Worker**
   - Implement for offline support
   - Cache static assets
   - Background sync for favorites

### Low Priority
1. **Component Props Validation**
   - Add runtime prop validation in dev mode
   - Better TypeScript interfaces for component props

## ⚡ PERFORMANCE TARGETS

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| LCP | ≤1.5s | ~2.1s | ⚠️ Needs work |
| FID | ≤100ms | ~80ms | ✅ Good |
| CLS | ≤0.1 | ~0.05 | ✅ Good |
| Bundle Size | ≤200KB | ~180KB | ✅ Good |
| Database | ≤100ms | ~70ms | ✅ Good |
