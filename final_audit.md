## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Launch)

### üö® 1. Sell Form - Continue Button Broken
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Users cannot sell items  
**Location:** `/sell` - Step 1 form

- Title: ‚úÖ Filled
- Category: ‚úÖ Selected
- Subcategory: ‚úÖ Selected  
- Description: ‚úÖ Filled
- Photo: ‚úÖ Uploaded

**Evidence:** Screenshot `sell-form-filled.png`

**Impact:** Social features completely broken  
**Location:** `/profile/[id]` routes

### üö® 3. Dashboard Upgrade Plans Malformed

**Correct vs Current:**

**Impact:** Users cannot understand plan differences, blocking subscription revenue

## High Priority Issues

- Missing "–ö—É–ø–∏ / –ü—Ä–æ–¥–∞–π" (Buy/Sell) buttons
- No clear next steps after onboarding
- Missed conversion opportunity

**Recommendation:** Add prominent CTAs to direct users to sell or browse immediately

## UI/UX Improvements Needed
