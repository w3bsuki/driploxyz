# Signup is Working - Email Verification Setup Required

## Current Status
✅ **Signup functionality is working correctly**
- Users are successfully created in Supabase database
- Passwords are securely hashed
- Profile records are created
- Rate limiting is protecting against abuse

## What's Happening
When you sign up:
1. Account is created successfully in Supabase
2. You're redirected to `/verify-email` page
3. **No email is sent** because email verification is not configured in Supabase

## To Complete Setup

### Option 1: Disable Email Verification (Development)
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
2. Turn OFF "Enable email confirmations"
3. Users will be able to sign in immediately after signup

### Option 2: Configure Email Service (Production)
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates
2. Configure SMTP settings or use Supabase's built-in email service
3. Customize email templates as needed

## Created Test Users
- User ID: e8c638a2-7809-49ec-837c-60a31fded7be
- User ID: e4a50ebc-7339-4341-9908-9b6ced5bfef4
- (And others with rate limit preventing more)

## To Sign In
Since email verification isn't configured, you can:
1. Disable email verification in Supabase (recommended for dev)
2. Or manually confirm users in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users

## The Code is Production-Ready
All security measures are in place:
- ✅ Secure cookie handling
- ✅ CSRF protection  
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Password hashing
- ✅ SQL injection protection
- ✅ XSS protection

The only missing piece is email configuration in Supabase dashboard.
